### Hi there!

I'm Jake Harkins, otherwise known as JonkDev online. I'm a current student at QUT, studying Games Design, majoring in Programming, and Science, majoring in Chemistry.
When I'm not studying, you'll find me working on personal projects, which are mostly games, and sometimes software.<br>
At the moment I'm working on a project "HexSurvival", a tile based game where you build a town using hexagonal tiles.<br>

You can see my projects and portfolio at: <br>
