### Hi there!

I'm Jake Harkins, otherwise known as JonkDev online. I'm a current student at QUT, studying Games Design, majoring in Programming, and Science, majoring in Chemistry.
When I'm not studying, you'll find me working on personal projects, which are mostly games, and sometimes software.<br>
At the moment, I'm focussing on a project named "HexSurvival", and have a third-person shooter in my game design backlog.<br>

You can see my projects and portfolio at: <br>
